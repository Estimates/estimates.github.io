    Forking a repository means you will create a separate repository on your account that you can change and afterwards propose your changes to the main source.

##Step 3) Edit posts

Folder **_posts** contains all posts and texts. You can edit posts straight from the web, navigating to the **_posts** folder, selecting a post of your choise and clicking a "pen". This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.
