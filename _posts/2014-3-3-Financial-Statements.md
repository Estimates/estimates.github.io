In this segment we'll examine fiancial statements issued by each public company.
 
Each company that has its stocks traded on a stock exchange is obliged to issue financial statements so that investors can invest accordingly.
 
The _income statement_ is one of the three financial statements - the other two are the _balance sheet_ and _cash flow statement_.
 
In the context of corporate financial reporting, the income statement summarizes a company's revenues (sales) and expenses quarterly and annually for its fiscal year. The final net figure, as well as various others in this statement, are of major interest to the investment community.
