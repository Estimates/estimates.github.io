Hello wonderer,

This is the **collaboration first** site where we teem up to work together on our projects appreciating the importance of such notions as **open source** and **collective knowledge**.
We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to power our goals and if you're new to Github in [README](https://github.com/Estimates/estimates.github.io/blob/master/README.md) you'll find detailed explanation how to get started and make your first contribution.

_N.B. All preparations have to be done only once, allowing you easy access to source files in any place, proposing your edits and collaborating on projects._
